In each cell, there are 46 chromosomes, found in 23 matching pairs. Half of the chromosomes are passed on from a person’s mother, and half from their father. These chromosomes carry our DNA, or genes, which are the instructions for how we look and how our body develops and functions. These instructions range from our eye color to our risk for disease.\n","\n","When a harmful change occurs in these instructions, it can change the way a baby develops. Babies with genetic disorders can be at risk of slow mental and physical development, physical abnormalities, and lifelong illnesses.\n","\n","Some genetic disorders are hereditary, meaning the genetic change is passed on from their parents. Other genetic changes can happen for the first time in the baby. Parents can carry a change in a gene or a chromosome without realizing it, as it may not cause them any health problems.\n","\n","> ### Risk Factors for Genetic Disorders\n","Factors that increase your risk of having a baby with a genetic disorder include:\n","- Family history of a genetic disorder.\n","- Prior child with a genetic disorder.\n","- One parent has a chromosomal abnormality.\n","- Advanced maternal age (35 or older).\n","- Advanced paternal age (40 or older).\n","- Multiple miscarriages or prior stillbirth.\n","- Prenatal exposure to Drugs, Alcohol, or other Environmental Factors.\n","\n","**Reference**: https://women.texaschildrens.org/program/high-risk-pregnancy-care/conditions/genetic-disorders"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"j7unR6oSt-hI","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1628828136944,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1727,"user":{"displayName":"EBEN EMMANUEL 2048009","photoUrl":"","userId":"12985643676354639562"}}},"source":["# Import Dependencies -To see the graphs in the notebook.\n","%matplotlib inline   \n","\n","# Python Imports\n","import math,time,random,datetime\n","\n","# Data Manipulation\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","# Visualization -This is where the graphs come in.\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import missingno\n","plt.style.use('ggplot')\n","\n","## Statistical Analysis\n","from scipy import stats\n","from scipy.stats import norm,skew\n","\n","# Display all Columns\n","pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\n","\n","# Ignore Warnings\n","import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Ox3KTlU_uSr7"},"source":["## 1.
