### **Introduction**

<p>Genetic disorders occur when a problem in the baby’s chromosomes or genes causes physical abnormalities or illnesses.

In our body, we have millions of cells. In each cell, there are 46 chromosomes, found in 23 matching pairs. Half of the chromosomes are passed on from a person’s mother, and half from their father. These chromosomes carry our DNA, or genes, which are the instructions for how we look and how our body develops and functions. These instructions range from our eye color to our risk for disease.

When a harmful change occurs in these instructions, it can change the way a baby develops. Babies with genetic disorders can be at risk of slow mental and physical development, physical abnormalities, and lifelong illnesses.

Some genetic disorders are hereditary, meaning the genetic change is passed on from their parents. Other genetic changes can happen for the first time in the baby. Parents can carry a change in a gene or a chromosome without realizing it, as it may not cause them any health problems.
